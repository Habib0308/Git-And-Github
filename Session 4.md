# Issues
On the top issues is like a discussion section where we discuss issues of the repository. like bugs and fixes and stuff.

After creating issue. 

## Open issue
When issue is not resolved it is open. only owner and issuer can close it.

So we solve it by commiting and when we commit we can use the issue number to mention it 

like this:

![issue](https://github.com/Habib0308/Git-And-Github/blob/master/images/issue.png)

We can also refer a commit hash in our issue section by pasting the hash code of the commit. 

## closed issue
We can close an issue by going to it and clicking close issue but also we can use keywork **fixes** with **issue number** to close an issue automatically.

Like this:

![fixes](https://github.com/Habib0308/Git-And-Github/blob/master/images/fixes.png)
