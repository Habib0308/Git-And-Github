Now Let's Talk about Pull Request
-- REQUEST --

Pulling something from somebody.
It's like pulling a brach from someone's repository.

Here I'll go to "Branch 1" and request "Master" to pull "Branch 1" into "Master".

I went to "Branch 1" and did a pull request.

Now I came back to Master and went to "pull request" menu on the top.
