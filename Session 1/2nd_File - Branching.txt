I'm gonna do the following operations here:

Each commit to a file Generates a new Commit hash

I'll Go to Master --> Create a new Branch --> "Branch 1" and I'll work on it.

Branch-1
Now I've Done above steps and now I'm in "Brach 1"

I can go to Graphs to see what I've done in my project so far

Now I'll Work on "Pull Request" and "Merge Request".
