# Fork
Someone has a repository(**repo_1**) on some account(Let's say **user_1**). I want to take that reposity and put it in my github account to use it seperately without changing the other **user_1**'s repository.
# Pull Request
I Forked **user_1**'s repository and made some changes in it and those changes are brilliant. I want to do is contribute my effort back to the persons repository. So i make a pull request for it. It's like requesting **user_1** to pull my contribution in his **repo_1**.
# How to Fork and edit someone's Repositoty
Go to ```user_1/repo_1``` and open file whichever you want and edit it. 

Another way is to go and click fork on top of that repository.

**For Example**: I forked this Repository of some user like this:

![fork](https://github.com/Habib0308/Git-And-Github/blob/master/images/fork.png)

And It shows up Like this afterwards:

![fork2](https://github.com/Habib0308/Git-And-Github/blob/master/images/fork%202.png)

Now i Can edit all i want.

It is good practice to create a seperate branch if you want to send a **pull request** but it will always propose to merge the changes in master branch.

Pretending I'm the user_1 and i recieve the pull request i can review the changes made in the pull request and i can commment a feedback and also merge the pull request if i want to
